PAR002	1	Provincial Groundwater Monitoring Network The Provincial Groundwater Monitoring Network (PGMN) datasets report on ambient (baseline) groundwater level and chemistry conditions. The raw data for this dataset together with data on precipitation and water levels is available as text and ESRI Shape files on the [Ontario.ca data catalog](https://www.ontario.ca/data/provincial-groundwater-monitoring-network).
PAR003	1	The %app_name% allows visualizing the raw data as different interactive plots and tables to gain further insight into trends and patterns not deceptable from the original data tables. The original data has been slightly extended, as described in the manual.
